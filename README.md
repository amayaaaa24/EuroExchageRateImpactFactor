# EuroExchageRateImpactFactor

In this project, we analyzed the exchange rate between the Euro and different countries. We examined the variation in the exchange rate between the Euro and the US dollar and identified three major phases: the rollout of the Euro in 1999, the financial crises in 2008, and the Brexit event in 2016. To validate our findings, we compared the exchange rate between the Euro and other countries. While the increase and decrease observed in the first two phases are generally applicable to most countries, the impact of the third phase varies.
